# python.quest is a code written as a part of an assaignment given me in a course called "Creativity Skills" during my 1st year as a Computer Science student at Ono AC
The assaignment demanded creating an "escape-room" for my fellow programmers(students) through Zoom in which they will have to solve riddles 
based on the materials thaught on various courses 
for example in this one : Python and Introduction with Coding
